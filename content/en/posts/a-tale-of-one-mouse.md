On December 31, 2017, my wife and I adopted two blind cats. Brothers. We got both because we did not want to separate them. Each relied on the other we noticed. Their names were Kittybun and Keiso. We did not want to change their names. The smaller of the two cats, keiso, died almost 7 months after we got them. I think he had feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) â€“ Neurological Form. Anyway, Kittybun came with a pet mouse. We kept it around because the foster couple said it was his favorite and we thought it would help acclimate him. Really short story short, here is a pic of that mouse 7 years later.
